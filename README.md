**Simplifying Recycling for a Better Tomorrow, Today**

## Inspiration and the Birth of a Solution

### The Problem
‚ÄúCan I recycle this item?‚Äù‚Äîa simple question with not-so-simple answers. A survey by Paper+Packaging revealed that about 50% of Americans who recycle are unsure of the correct recycling techniques. This confusion often leads to improper recycling or, worse, abandonment of the practice, contributing to escalating waste pollution and environmental degradation.

### A New Hope
To tackle this growing issue, we created **EcoScan**. By leveraging the transformative potential of Generative AI and the universal human drive for achievement, EcoScan incentivizes and educates communities to recycle effectively. The platform is accessible on any device with a camera and integrates seamlessly with Google‚Äôs accessibility features, such as text-to-speech and auto-translate. This ensures inclusivity, making recycling tips and techniques available to marginalized communities and non-English speakers.

## What EcoScan Does
EcoScan is a user-friendly web application designed to:
1. **Educate**: Scan any item to receive detailed recycling instructions.  
2. **Incentivize**: Gamify recycling with a points system that rewards users based on the environmental impact of recycling specific items.  
3. **Build Community**: Display a leaderboard showcasing the top recyclers, fostering healthy competition and a sense of communal achievement.

By assuming that scanned items are recycled, the app automatically tracks and scores users‚Äô efforts to motivate sustained participation.
